###2014 Site Redesign
[14-Redesign Link](http://joeldom.github.io/14-redesign/)

This version was intended to be a full redesign build out using **Bootstrap** instead of **Foundation**. Some of the ideas going in where to include features such as: compiling, versioning, all in a responisve framework with dynamic content.

My site itself has always been the primary showcase of work along with the projects contained within. It is meant to show the culmination of knowledge & trends I have been using in client projects and felt to pluck out and exemplify my work.

###Specs

- Bootstrap
- Wordpress
- Font Awesome
- SASS

I went through my recent design projects and pulled out these styles that I use all the time to create an easy-to-import stylesheet. They help me get a new design started, and I hope they help you too!

###Workflow
* Style Refinement
  *  Ordered sub-list 
*  Theme Sectioning

###Documentation
Along with evaluating how the site would be made and work I also wanted to provide more info throughout the process so that future changes and input could be done much more easily.
